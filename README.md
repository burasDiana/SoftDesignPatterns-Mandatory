# Software Design Patterns project
This is an application which simulates a cross platform game console. The console is used to display a list of games, play games for different platforms as well as use dlc's when available for a specific game. It uses different design patterns, learned in the Software Design Patterns course, to implement these features. 

# Design patterns used 
`Adapter Pattern`
`Decorator Pattern`
`Singleton Pattern`
`Filter Pattern`
